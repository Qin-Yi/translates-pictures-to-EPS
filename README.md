# translates-pictures-to-EPS
This is my First Python HW (Mar, 2016) 

Translation is an important task for computers. 
Many tools translate programs from one language to another, such as compilers. 
In homework 1--4, you will develop a tool that translates pictures in the Shine language to Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). In homework 5, you will draw a picture in Shine.
